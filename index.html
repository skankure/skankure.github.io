                                    Hello, my name is Supriya and I am currently a student at Umass Amherst pursuing a degree in computer science. When I was in high school, I had the opportunity to take a course outside the standard curriculum: java programming. Initially, I was unsure of what to expect, but once I began the course, I fell in love with programming. I was fascinated by the power of just a few lines of code, as the possibilities were endless. I wanted to continue to learn about coding, so I subsequently took AP Computer Science and webpage design. I knew by my senior year of high school, that I wanted to major in computer science.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>

                                    At college, I am pursuing a specialization in software engineering within my major. I am expected to graduate in May 2017. A highlight of my course work includes data structures, discrete mathematics, web programming, algorithms, software engineering, human computer interaction, product management, and information systems.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>

                                    Outside of the classroom, I enjoy being able to have an impact on the community. I currently serve as an undergraduate co-chair for Umass Amherst's Computer Science Women's Group. Additionally, I have worked with CAITE, which is an organization that provides outreach for K-12 teachers to incorporate computer science in their curriculums. Currently, I am serving as a student programmer for a mobile app development project that will help underprivileged high school students stay up to par in biology courses.

                                    </br>
                                    </br>

                                    I enjoy being a part of opportunities that challenge me and push me to be the best I can be. I enjoy programming, and aspire to be a software engineer in the future. I hope you enjoy my website. Thanks for visiting! Be sure to connect with me below.

									For summer 2016, I was an intern at Fidelity Investments. I refactored large and outdated Javascript code by implementing new coding logic. This in turn allowed the application to run faster, and use 50% less code. 
                                    I additionally, got to work with large databases. I would look at large queries and test them to make sure the queries were
										picking up bad data, and marking the data as bad. If something was wrong with the query, I would
                                locate where the issue was, and rewrite the query to be correct. In addition to my coding assignments,
										I competing in an intern research project and won first place out of 15 teams. Subsequently, my
										team and got to present our research to Fidelity CIOS. -->
